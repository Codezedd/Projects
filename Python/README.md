Project involved using hashlib library in python to conduct a dictionary attack on three hashed passwords stores in hex files.
Second part of assignment required finding passwords based on hash values generated from salted passwords.
Steps included taking the byte value of the salt, combining with the byte value of the dictionary entry, and finally hashing together to compared hash values
from the salted hash values stored in hex files. 

Different hashing algorithms were used: MD5, Sha-1, and Sha-256
