Assignment was an introduction to using socket programming with a web browser.
Goal of the assignment was to collect the input on a local host web browser which was two numbers to add together
then we collect the GET response from the local host, extract the number and username entered, do the addition calculation, 
recompile the answer and username into a html response, and send it to the browser/localhost using sockets and a predefined port.
