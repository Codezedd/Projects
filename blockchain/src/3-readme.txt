This miniproject D was a bit more easier to do since I initially had to move on from miniproject C to understand the argument
handling when I wanted to read the blockinput.txt files for mini project C. This process in D was more straight forward
since what we are trying to do is take the console input from the user and insert input into a method that can differentiate
between the numbers 0,1,2 since those numbers were used to tell which file we want to access like we did in miniproject C.
Some of the utility code we ran before starting the mini project was helpful especially using the switch statement to properly
identify what number would be used to print out the "Hello Process" message.
