purpose of the miniproject B was to actually work with some real data from the main blockchain blockinput.txt
files and step by step work to get each piece of data into a json file.

it has been a while since I actually worked with JSON so I had to do some refreshing on what the json was doing
when we were writing it to a JSON file.

to simplify what we were doing in this mini project, we were creating a block record, hardcoding some data for
some of the data in the block record such as first name, last name, etc, we used the getters and setters to set our
data to our variables, combined our data into a simple string that will be used in the hash calculation to generate
our unique has value to the block before adding it to the block chain. This was what I was understanding as I was adding
the data to the block record so far. Of course the last step was actually seeing if we got a json file and we did which
was named "blockrecordB.json"
