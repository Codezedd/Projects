Miniproject C was similar to what we were doing in B, but instead we were trying to read back our JSON file with
the code we wrote in mini project B. this one was a bit more complex because I inadvertently made a lists of list in
a sense without it sounding more confusing. When I added the java object to the json file I believe I had sent them as
an list with our block record data and put those block records list into another larger list of block record list.
what I ended up doing was just reading out the each list in the list instead of actually reading through the data in the
block record list that was a part of the larger list. But after some discussion post viewing and a little bit more research
I was able to properly to iterate through are main list to get data from or block record list.
