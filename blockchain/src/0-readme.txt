purpose of miniproject A is to just get familiar with the steps of what makes a blockchain.
following the guides provided on D2L and some of the utility code was helpful to understand what
we are doing with the data and the hashes in a block and how we add the simple blocks to the chain.

At first I was having difficult with the concept of what the block and block record was actually.
After some reading through sources and utility code I understood that the block is what comprises of the blockchain
and the data that is in the block is the actual variable that would contain the block record information.

This is a simple blockchain next step would be to add the actual data we want which is firstname, lastname, DOB, or
UUID for example. As well as using JSON and JSON files to fill our data for the block.
